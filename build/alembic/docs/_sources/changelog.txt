    :version: 0.6.5
    :released: May 3, 2014

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, autogenerate, mysql
      :tickets: 202

      This releases' "autogenerate index detection" bug, when a MySQL table
      includes an Index with the same name as a column, autogenerate reported
      it as an "add" even though its not; this is because we ignore reflected
      indexes of this nature due to MySQL creating them implicitly.  Indexes
      that are named the same as a column are now ignored on
      MySQL if we see that the backend is reporting that it already exists;
      this indicates that we can still detect additions of these indexes
      but not drops, as we cannot distinguish a backend index same-named
      as the column as one that is user generated or mysql-generated.

    .. change::
      :tags: feature, environment
      :tickets: 201

      Added new feature :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.transaction_per_migration`,
      which when True causes the BEGIN/COMMIT pair to incur for each migration
      individually, rather than for the whole series of migrations.  This is
      to assist with some database directives that need to be within individual
      transactions, without the need to disable transactional DDL entirely.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, autogenerate
      :tickets: 200

      Fixed bug where the ``include_object()`` filter would not receive
      the original :class:`.Column` object when evaluating a database-only
      column to be dropped; the object would not include the parent
      :class:`.Table` nor other aspects of the column that are important
      for generating the "downgrade" case where the column is recreated.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, environment
      :tickets: 195

      Fixed bug where :meth:`.EnvironmentContext.get_x_argument`
      would fail if the :class:`.Config` in use didn't actually
      originate from a command line call.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, autogenerate
      :tickets: 194

      Fixed another bug regarding naming conventions, continuing
      from :ticket:`183`, where add_index()
      drop_index() directives would not correctly render the ``f()``
      construct when the index contained a convention-driven name.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.6.4
    :released: March 28, 2014

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, mssql
      :tickets: 186

      Added quoting to the table name when the special EXEC is run to
      drop any existing server defaults or constraints when the
      :paramref:`.drop_column.mssql_drop_check` or
      :paramref:`.drop_column.mssql_drop_default`
      arguments are used.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, mysql
      :tickets: 103

      Added/fixed support for MySQL "SET DEFAULT" / "DROP DEFAULT" phrases,
      which will now be rendered if only the server default is changing
      or being dropped (e.g. specify None to alter_column() to indicate
      "DROP DEFAULT").  Also added support for rendering MODIFY rather than
      CHANGE when the column name isn't changing.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug
      :tickets: 190

      Added support for the ``initially``, ``match`` keyword arguments
      as well as dialect-specific keyword arguments to
      :meth:`.Operations.create_foreign_key`.

      :tags: feature
      :tickets: 163

      Altered the support for "sourceless" migration files (e.g. only
      .pyc or .pyo present) so that the flag "sourceless=true" needs to
      be in alembic.ini for this behavior to take effect.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, mssql
      :tickets: 185

      The feature that keeps on giving, index/unique constraint autogenerate
      detection, has even more fixes, this time to accommodate database dialects
      that both don't yet report on unique constraints, but the backend
      does report unique constraints as indexes.   The logic
      Alembic uses to distinguish between "this is an index!" vs.
      "this is a unique constraint that is also reported as an index!" has now
      been further enhanced to not produce unwanted migrations when the dialect
      is observed to not yet implement get_unique_constraints() (e.g. mssql).
      Note that such a backend will no longer report index drops for unique
      indexes, as these cannot be distinguished from an unreported unique
      index.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug
      :tickets: 183

      Extensive changes have been made to more fully support SQLAlchemy's new
      naming conventions feature.  Note that while SQLAlchemy has added this
      feature as of 0.9.2, some additional fixes in 0.9.4 are needed to
      resolve some of the issues:

      1. The :class:`.Operations` object now takes into account the naming
         conventions that are present on the :class:`.MetaData` object that's
         associated using :paramref:`~.EnvironmentContext.configure.target_metadata`.
         When :class:`.Operations` renders a constraint directive like
         ``ADD CONSTRAINT``, it now will make use of this naming convention
         when it produces its own temporary :class:`.MetaData` object.

      2. Note however that the autogenerate feature in most cases generates
         constraints like foreign keys and unique constraints with the
         final names intact; the only exception are the constraints implicit
         with a schema-type like Boolean or Enum.  In most of these cases,
         the naming convention feature will not take effect for these constraints
         and will instead use the given name as is, with one exception....

      3. Naming conventions which use the ``"%(constraint_name)s"`` token, that
         is, produce a new name that uses the original name as a component,
         will still be pulled into the naming convention converter and be
         converted.  The problem arises when autogenerate renders a constraint
         with it's already-generated name present in the migration file's source
         code, the name will be doubled up at render time due to the combination
         of #1 and #2.  So to work around this, autogenerate now renders these
         already-tokenized names using the new :meth:`.Operations.f` component.
         This component is only generated if **SQLAlchemy 0.9.4** or greater
         is in use.

      Therefore it is highly recommended that an upgrade to Alembic 0.6.4
      be accompanied by an upgrade of SQLAlchemy 0.9.4, if the new naming
      conventions feature is used.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug
      :tickets: 160

      Suppressed IOErrors which can raise when program output pipe
      is closed under a program like ``head``; however this only
      works on Python 2.  On Python 3, there is not yet a known way to
      suppress the BrokenPipeError warnings without prematurely terminating
      the program via signals.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug
      :tickets: 179

      Fixed bug where :meth:`.Operations.bulk_insert` would not function
      properly when :meth:`.Operations.inline_literal` values were used,
      either in --sql or non-sql mode.    The values will now render
      directly in --sql mode.  For compatibility with "online" mode,
      a new flag :paramref:`~.Operations.bulk_insert.multiinsert`
      can be set to False which will cause each parameter set to be
      compiled and executed with individual INSERT statements.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, py3k
      :tickets: 175

      Fixed a failure of the system that allows "legacy keyword arguments"
      to be understood, which arose as of a change in Python 3.4 regarding
      decorators.  A workaround is applied that allows the code to work
      across Python 3 versions.

    .. change::
      :tags: feature
      :pullreq: bitbucket:20

      The :func:`.command.revision` command now returns the :class:`.Script`
      object corresponding to the newly generated revision.  From this
      structure, one can get the revision id, the module documentation,
      and everything else, for use in scripts that call upon this command.
      Pull request courtesy Robbie Coomber.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.6.3
    :released: February 2, 2014

    .. change::
      :tags: bug
      :tickets: 172

      Added a workaround for when we call ``fcntl.ioctl()`` to get at
      ``TERMWIDTH``; if the function returns zero, as is reported to occur
      in some pseudo-ttys, the message wrapping system is disabled in the
      same way as if ``ioctl()`` failed.

    .. change::
      :tags: feature
      :tickets: 171

      Added new argument
      :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.user_module_prefix`.
      This prefix is applied when autogenerate renders a user-defined type,
      which here is defined as any type that is from a module outside of the
      ``sqlalchemy.`` hierarchy.   This prefix defaults to ``None``, in
      which case the :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.sqlalchemy_module_prefix`
      is used, thus preserving the current behavior.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug
      :tickets: 170

      Added support for autogenerate covering the use case where :class:`.Table`
      objects specified in the metadata have an explicit ``schema`` attribute
      whose name matches that of the connection's default schema
      (e.g. "public" for Postgresql).  Previously, it was assumed that "schema"
      was ``None`` when it matched the "default" schema, now the comparison
      adjusts for this.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug
      :pullreq: github:9

      The :func:`.compare_metadata` public API function now takes into
      account the settings for
      :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.include_object`,
      :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.include_symbol`,
      and :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.include_schemas`, in the
      same way that the ``--autogenerate`` command does.  Pull
      request courtesy Roman Podoliaka.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug
      :tickets: 168

      Calling :func:`.bulk_insert` with an empty list will not emit any
      commands on the current connection.  This was already the case with
      ``--sql`` mode, so is now the case with "online" mode.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug
      :pullreq: bitbucket:17

     Enabled schema support for index and unique constraint autodetection;
     previously these were non-functional and could in some cases lead to
     attribute errors.  Pull request courtesy Dimitris Theodorou.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug
      :tickets: 164

     More fixes to index autodetection; indexes created with expressions
     like DESC or functional indexes will no longer cause AttributeError
     exceptions when attempting to compare the columns.

    .. change::
      :tags: feature
      :tickets: 163

     The :class:`.ScriptDirectory` system that loads migration files
     from a  ``versions/`` directory now supports so-called
     "sourceless" operation,  where the ``.py`` files are not present
     and instead ``.pyc`` or ``.pyo`` files are directly present where
     the ``.py`` files should be.  Note that while Python 3.3 has a
     new system of locating ``.pyc``/``.pyo`` files within a directory
     called ``__pycache__`` (e.g. PEP-3147), PEP-3147 maintains
     support for the "source-less imports" use case, where the
     ``.pyc``/``.pyo`` are in present in the "old" location, e.g. next
     to the ``.py`` file; this is the usage that's supported even when
     running Python3.3.


.. changelog::
    :version: 0.6.2
    :released: Fri Dec 27 2013

    .. change::
      :tags: bug

      Autogenerate for ``op.create_table()`` will not include a
      ``PrimaryKeyConstraint()`` that has no columns.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug

      Fixed bug in the not-internally-used :meth:`.ScriptDirectory.get_base`
      method which would fail if called on an empty versions directory.

      An almost-rewrite of the new unique constraint/index autogenerate
      detection, to accommodate a variety of issues.  The emphasis is on
      not generating false positives for those cases where no net change
      is present, as these errors are the ones that impact all autogenerate
      runs:

        * Fixed an issue with unique constraint autogenerate detection where
          a named ``UniqueConstraint`` on both sides with column changes would
          render with the "add" operation before the "drop", requiring the
          user to reverse the order manually.

        * Corrected for MySQL's apparent addition of an implicit index
          for a foreign key column, so that it doesn't show up as "removed".
          This required that the index/constraint autogen system query the
          dialect-specific implementation for special exceptions.

        * reworked the "dedupe" logic to accommodate MySQL's bi-directional
          duplication of unique indexes as unique constraints, and unique
          constraints as unique indexes.  Postgresql's slightly different
          logic of duplicating unique constraints into unique indexes
          continues to be accommodated as well.  Note that a unique index
          or unique constraint removal on a backend that duplicates these may
          show up as a distinct "remove_constraint()" / "remove_index()" pair,
          which may need to be corrected in the post-autogenerate if multiple
          backends are being supported.

        * added another dialect-specific exception to the SQLite backend
          when dealing with unnamed unique constraints, as the backend can't
          currently report on constraints that were made with this technique,
          hence they'd come out as "added" on every run.

        * the ``op.create_table()`` directive will be auto-generated with
          the ``UniqueConstraint`` objects inline, but will not double them
          up with a separate ``create_unique_constraint()`` call, which may
          have been occurring.  Indexes still get rendered as distinct
          ``op.create_index()`` calls even when the corresponding table was
          created in the same script.

        * the inline ``UniqueConstraint`` within ``op.create_table()`` includes
          all the options like ``deferrable``, ``initially``, etc.  Previously
          these weren't rendering.

    .. change::
      :tags: feature, mssql

      Added new argument ``mssql_drop_foreign_key`` to
      :meth:`.Operations.drop_column`.  Like ``mssql_drop_default``
      and ``mssql_drop_check``, will do an inline lookup for a
      single foreign key which applies to this column, and drop it.
      For a column with more than one FK, you'd still need to explicitly
      use :meth:`.Operations.drop_constraint` given the name,
      even though only MSSQL has this limitation in the first place.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, mssql
      :pullreq: bitbucket:13

      The MSSQL backend will add the batch separator (e.g. ``"GO"``)
      in ``--sql`` mode after the final ``COMMIT`` statement, to ensure
      that statement is also processed in batch mode.  Courtesy
      Derek Harland.

    :released: Wed Nov 27 2013

    .. change::
      :tags: bug, mysql
      :tickets: 152

      Fixed bug where :func:`.op.alter_column` in the MySQL dialect
      would fail to apply quotes to column names that had mixed casing
      or spaces.

    .. change::
      :tags: feature
      :pullreq: bitbucket:12

      Expanded the size of the "slug" generated by "revision" to 40
      characters, which is also configurable by new field
      ``truncate_slug_length``; and also split on the word rather than the
      character; courtesy Frozenball.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug
      :tickets: 135

      Fixed the output wrapping for Alembic message output, so that
      we either get the terminal width for "pretty printing" with
      indentation, or if not we just output the text as is; in any
      case the text won't be wrapped too short.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug
      :pullreq: bitbucket:9

      Fixes to Py3k in-place compatibity regarding output encoding and related;
      the use of the new io.* package introduced some incompatibilities on Py2k.
      These should be resolved, due to the introduction of new adapter types
      for translating from io.* to Py2k file types, StringIO types.
      Thanks to Javier Santacruz for help with this.

      when using the list_templates command.  Courtesy Chris Wilkes.

    .. change::
      :tags: feature
      :tickets: 107

      Support for autogeneration detection and rendering of indexes and
      unique constraints has been added.  The logic goes through some effort
      in order to differentiate between true unique constraints and
      unique indexes, where there are some quirks on backends like Postgresql.

    .. change::
      :tags: bug

      Fixed bug introduced by new ``include_object`` argument where the
      inspected column would be misinterpreted when using a user-defined
      type comparison function, causing a KeyError or similar expression-related
      error.  Fix courtesy Maarten van Schaik.

    .. change::

      Added the "deferrable" keyword argument to :func:`.op.create_foreign_key`

      Ensured that strings going to stdout go through an encode/decode phase,
      so that any non-ASCII characters get to the output stream correctly
      in both Py2k and Py3k.   Also added source encoding detection using
      Mako's parse_encoding() routine in Py2k so that the __doc__ of a
      non-ascii revision file can be treated as unicode in Py2k.

    :version: 0.6.0
    :released: Fri July 19 2013

    .. change::
      :tags: feature
      :tickets: 101

      Added new kw argument to :meth:`.EnvironmentContext.configure`
      ``include_object``.  This is a more flexible version of the
      ``include_symbol`` argument which allows filtering of columns as well as tables
      from the autogenerate process,
      and in the future will also work for types, constraints and
      other constructs.  The fully constructed schema object is passed,
      including its name and type as well as a flag indicating if the object
      is from the local application metadata or is reflected.

      The rendering of any construct during autogenerate
      can be customized, in particular to allow special rendering
      for user-defined column, constraint subclasses, using new
      ``render_item`` argument to
      :meth:`.EnvironmentContext.configure`.

      The "implicit" constraint generated by a

      ALTER statement when run on SQlite, which does not
      support ALTER for the purpose of adding/removing
      constraints separate from the column def itself.
      While SQLite supports adding a CHECK constraint
      at the column level, SQLAlchemy would need modification
      to support this.

      constraint cannot be added in this scenario.

      Support for tables in alternate schemas

      the autogenerate feature.  When using autogenerate,
      specifying the flag include_schemas=True to

      which is supported by *some* (but not all)

           with only one set of parameters, working
           around SQLAlchemy bug #2461 in this regard.
        3. bulk_insert() uses "inline=True" so that phrases

           single-row bulk inserts.

      API rearrangement allows everything

      upon global configuration variables.
      The rearrangement was done such that
      existing migrations should be OK,
      as long as they use the pattern
      of "from alembic import context" and
      "from alembic import op", as these

      environment, but should still be considered
      ALPHA LEVEL SOFTWARE as of this release,
      particularly in that many features are expected
      to be missing / unimplemented.   Major API
      changes are not anticipated but for the moment
      nothing should be assumed.

      The author asks that you *please* report all
      issues, missing features, workarounds etc.
      to the bugtracker, at
      https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/alembic/issues/new .

      Python 3 is supported and has been tested.

      The "Pylons" and "MultiDB" environment templates
      have not been directly tested - these should be
      considered to be samples to be modified as
      needed.   Multiple database support itself
      is well tested, however.

      Postgresql and MS SQL Server environments
      have been tested for several weeks in a production
      environment.  In particular, some involved workarounds
      were implemented to allow fully-automated dropping
      of default- or constraint-holding columns with
      SQL Server.

      MySQL support has also been implemented to a
      basic degree, including MySQL's awkward style
      of modifying columns being accommodated.

      Other database environments not included among
      those three have *not* been tested, *at all*.  This
      includes Firebird, Oracle, Sybase.   Adding
      support for these backends should be
      straightforward.  Please report all missing/
      incorrect behaviors to the bugtracker! Patches
      are welcome here but are optional - please just
      indicate the exact format expected by the target
      database.

      SQLite, as a backend, has almost no support for
      schema alterations to existing databases.  The author
      would strongly recommend that SQLite not be used in
      a migration context - just dump your SQLite database
      into an intermediary format, then dump it back
      into a new schema.  For dev environments, the
      dev installer should be building the whole DB from
      scratch.  Or just use Postgresql, which is a much
      better database for non-trivial schemas.
      Requests for full ALTER support on SQLite should be
      reported to SQLite's bug tracker at
      http://www.sqlite.org/src/wiki?name=Bug+Reports,
      as Alembic will not be implementing the
      "rename the table to a temptable then copy the
      data into a new table" workaround.
      Note that Alembic will at some point offer an
      extensible API so that you can implement commands
      like this yourself.

      Well-tested directives include add/drop table, add/drop
      column, including support for SQLAlchemy "schema"
      types which generate additional CHECK
      constraints, i.e. Boolean, Enum.  Other directives not
      included here have *not* been strongly tested
      in production, i.e. rename table, etc.

      Both "online" and "offline" migrations, the latter
      being generated SQL scripts to hand off to a DBA,
      have been strongly production tested against
      Postgresql and SQL Server.

      Modify column type, default status, nullable, is

      but not yet widely tested in production usage.

      Many migrations are still outright missing, i.e.
      create/add sequences, etc.  As a workaround,
      execute() can be used for those which are missing,
      though posting of tickets for new features/missing
      behaviors is strongly encouraged.

      Autogenerate feature is implemented and has been
      tested, though only a little bit in a production setting.
      In particular, detection of type and server
      default changes are optional and are off by default;
      they can also be customized by a callable.
      Both features work but can have surprises particularly
      the disparity between BIT/TINYINT and boolean,
      which hasn't yet been worked around, as well as
      format changes performed by the database on defaults
      when it reports back.  When enabled, the PG dialect
      will execute the two defaults to be compared to
      see if they are equivalent.  Other backends may
      need to do the same thing.

      The autogenerate feature only generates
      "candidate" commands which must be hand-tailored
      in any case, so is still a useful feature and
      is safe to use.  Please report missing/broken features
      of autogenerate!  This will be a great feature and
      will also improve SQLAlchemy's reflection services.

      Support for non-ASCII table, column and constraint
      names is mostly nonexistent.   This is also a
      straightforward feature add as SQLAlchemy itself
      supports unicode identifiers; Alembic itself will
      likely need fixes to logging, column identification
      by key, etc. for full support here.
